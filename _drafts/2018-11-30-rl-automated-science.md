title: Automated science
---
<!--

I want to get across.

Achieving model based RL, exploration/curiosity, and transfer.
Is the same as the automation of science. And it is possible!

 -->

The goal of automated science would be to understand the universe and what is possible and provable, knowledge of the truth. This is a different goal to solving intelligence, which is the ability to efficiently achieve goals [ref].
(although closely related, if you have a good model you can plan... and if you can achieve goals, you can learn about the universe. see X for a discussion.)

## RL

Some background first. RL =

Model based =

=> Science (and math)!

## What is science?

I claim, based on sitting down and thinking about it, that there are three main parts to science.
- occam's razor,
- explanation/understanding
- falsifiaction

So, to achieve automated science we need to formalise these.

<!-- And what about automated math!? Exploring imaginary worlds!? -->


## Setting

RL env. An agent that is rewarded for;
- compression,
- novelty
- explainability
- beauty
- surprise

## Road map

- [Discovering physical concepts with neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10300)
- [Toward an AI Physicist for Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10525)

### Benchmarks




## Open problems

- Hierarchical exploration. Still need to learn a policy!?
- How hard is it to learn to learn? What is the computational complexity of learning new learning strategies? Such as randomosed controlled trials, counterfactuals, interventions and dose-response... Correction for counfounders. (and how can they be represented in the most general way?) When do these strategies naturally emergy? What is the space of strategies to be explored?
- Recover structure. The topology of variables. Symmetrics.

How can a learner think:
Imagine X. Actually I dont understand X well. Let's investigate.

(needs to explore potential/observed/counterfactual trajectories and check if they are explainable.)

This goal is very close to my own personal goals in life. I want to understand the universe.
The politicians can argue over the policy.
