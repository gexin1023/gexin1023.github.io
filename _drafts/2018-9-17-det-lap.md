title: The determinant and the Laplacian
---

The __Determinant__ is a measure of how a linear function scales a vector space (_does it get stretched or contracted?_). The __Laplacian__ is a measure of how a gradient field expands/contracts space. These two notions have similar interpretations, yet their equations look different. What is the connection?

(_If you are stuggling to care, skip to <a href="#why-should-we-care">Why should we care?</a>_)

## The Determinant

The most intuitive definition of the determinant (in my opinion) is;

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Let } y &= Ax \\
\det(A) &= \prod_{i=0}^n \sigma_i \\
\end{align}
$$

<side>SVD decoposition: any matrix $A$ can be decomposed as $A = USV^T$, where $U, V$ are unitary and $S$ is a diagonal matrix.</side>
assuming you are familiar with [SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition), you will know that the singular values of the SVD decomposition $\sigma_i$ are the scaling factors applied by the transformation $A$. Thus their product tells us how a unit square would change volume as it is scaled.

## Laplacian

The laplacian of a (continuious fn?) is defined as the divergence of the gradient.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{div}(\nabla f) &= \nabla \cdot \nabla f \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{\partial^2 f_i}{\partial x_i^2} \\
\end{align}
$$

But why have we ignored the cross terms $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_k}$? I would have expected these to be present in a measure of how volume expands.

What does it do? Need some intuition!! TODO

## Exterior algebra

Ok. After a while stumbling around wikipedia, a few bright ideas that were quickly extnguished, and many combinations of keywords I saw the connection! It's the exterior algebra (I was actually given a hint by one of my professors that this was the case, but it still took me a while to find the connection...).

> The exterior algebra Λ(V) of a vector space V over a field K is defined as the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra T(V) by the two-sided ideal I generated by all elements of the form x ⊗ x for x ∈ V.

Good. I am sure that cleared everything up...


$$
\begin{align}
e_2 \wedge e_1 &= −(e_1 \wedge e_2) \\
e_i \wedge e_i &= 0 \\
\end{align}
$$

(why are these true?)

Awesome. We copied down the math. But what does it really mean?

- A 2-blade space only has 1 dimension $(e_1 \wedge e_2)$. A 3-blade space has 3 dimensions $(e_1 \wedge e_2), (e_2 \wedge e_3), (e_1 \wedge e_3)$. A 4-blade has 6 $(12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34)$.

#### The determinant's relationship with the <u>exterior product</u>

What is the exterior product? (TODO want to explain/give intuition)

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf u &= u_1e_1 + u_2e_2 \\
\mathbf v &= v_1e_1 + v_2e_2 \\
\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v &= u_1v_1 (e_1\wedge e_1) + u_2v_1 (e_2\wedge e_1) + u_1v_2 (e_1\wedge e_2) + u_2v_2 (e_2\wedge e_2) \\
&= 0 + (-)u_2v_1(e_1\wedge e_2) + u_1v_2 (e_1\wedge e_2) + 0 \\
&= (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)(e_1 \wedge e_2) \\
\end{align}
$$

Should be easy to see the relation to the determinant.

$$
\begin{align}
A &= [\mathbf u, \mathbf v] \tag{stack the vectors}\\
\det (A) &= u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \\
\end{align}
$$

But they are not quite the same (?). For a measure of area we require;

$$
\begin{align}
A(i\mathbf u, j\mathbf v) &= ijA(\mathbf u, \mathbf v) \\
A(\mathbf u, \mathbf u) &= 0 \\
A(\mathbf u, \mathbf v) &= -A(\mathbf v, \mathbf u) \\
A(\mathbf u + j\mathbf v, \mathbf v) &= A(\mathbf u, \mathbf v) \\
A(\mathbf e_1, \mathbf e_2) &= 1 \\
\end{align}
$$

(oh. kk. it is like a generalisation of the determinant to higher dims?!)


### Divergence

Ok, next.

(quick review)


To be more careful. The divergence measures the 'flux' of

$$
\begin{align}
\text{div}F &= \lim_{V \to p} \int_{S(V)} \frac{F \cdot n(S)}{\mid V\mid } dS \\
&= \nabla \cdot F \tag{!?!}\\
\end{align}
$$

- is it possible to have negative flux in some dims and positive in others?

#### Divergence's relation with the <u>exterior derivative</u>

What is the exterior derivative? (TODO want to explain/give intuition)

One can express the divergence as a particular case of the exterior derivative, which takes a 2-form to a 3-form in R3. Define the current two-form as

$$
\begin{align}
j &= F_1 dy \wedge dz + F_2 dx \wedge dz + F_3 dx \wedge dy \\
\end{align}
$$


It measures the amount of "stuff" flowing through a surface per unit time in a "stuff fluid" of density $ρ = 1 dx \wedge dy \wedge dz$ moving with local velocity $F$. Its exterior derivative $dj$ is then given by

$$
\begin{align}
dj &= \Big( \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z} \Big) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
\end{align}
$$

## Why should we care?

The ability to measure how a tran

## Jacobi's formula

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \det A(t) &= tr\Big(adj(A(t)) \frac{dA(t)}{dt}\Big)\\
adj(A) &= \det (A) \cdot A^{-1} \\
\frac{d}{dt} \det A(t) &= tr\Big(\det (A) \cdot A^{-1}(t) \cdot \frac{dA(t)}{dt}\Big) \\
\end{align}
$$
potentially useful?
$$
tr(A) = log(det(exp(A))) \\
$$
Nah. that's just using exp to turn multiplication into summation.
